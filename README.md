# Thanks
We thank NVST for providing the research data, and we also appreciate the open data from other observatories, such as SDO and BBSO. Additionally, we acknowledge the contributions of earlier researchers in establishing a robust root environment, particularly the development of Bit-Swap. Our core work is built upon Bit-Swap, which has contributed to advancements in the field of lossless compression for astronomical observation data.
