# AstroDLLC
Welcome to the official repository for the AstroDLLC project! This repository hosts the key source code and datasets used in our paper, "AstroDLLC: Efficiently Reducing Storage and Transmission Costs for Massive Solar Observation Data via Deep Learning-Based Lossless Compression."

# Project Overview
AstroDLLC is a deep learning-based lossless compression algorithm designed to significantly reduce the storage and transmission costs associated with massive solar observation data.

# Repository Contents
1. Source Code: Contains key code to implement the AstroDLLC algorithm.
2. Datasets: Includes sample datasets used to evaluate the performance of the compression algorithm as presented in the paper.

# Getting Started
We are currently preparing detailed documentation and setup instructions. Please check back soon for updated guidelines on how to get started with the AstroDLLC project.
